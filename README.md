Objective :
This project demonstrates creating a RESTful API with Flask in Python. It offers a basic interface for managing a list of items with operations to create, read, update, and delete items, serving as an introduction to RESTful web services.

Key Features:
Basic Routing: Handles HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Data Handling: Manages a list of items using Python dictionaries, simulating a simple data store.
JSON Responses: Ensures that all responses are in JSON format, which is the standard for APIs.
CRUD Operations: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, covering the full spectrum of basic API functionality.
Error Handling: Includes simple error handling to ensure the API behaves predictably with various inputs.
